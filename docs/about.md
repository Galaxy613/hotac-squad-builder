# Hotac Ship Builder

## Background

This is a web based ship builder and campaign tracker for the [Heroes of the Aturi Cluster](http://dockingbay416.com/campaign/) (hotac) campaign for the x-wing miniatures game.

The concept was originally built to help my campaign players by collecting all the options for upgrading their ships in one place, but has since grown into a fully fledged system for tracking pilot experience, upgardes, enemies etc. and can be used as a reference sheet during a game instead of needing the printed paper ship sheet and upgrade cards.

## Documentation

The application is wrriten as HTML, CSS and Javascript, which means that it runs right inside your web browser. Everything you do is saved in the URL of the app, and you may notice this changing as you update your ship.

To save your current status, simply copy the URL (either directly or via the "export" menu option)

### Getting started


## Acknowledgements
This project couldn't exist without the excellent open source x-wing community. I would like to acknowledge the following amazing project, without which this application would be possible:

* [X-Wing symbols font](https://github.com/geordanr/xwing-miniatures-font) courtesy Hinny and Josh Derksen which is used for the dynamic ship stats and dial.
* [X-wing card data and images](https://github.com/guidokessels/xwing-data) courtesy of "guidokessels" which is essential for the upgrade card system and card images.
* And of course, the [Heroes of the Aturi Cluster](http://dockingbay416.com/campaign/) campaign itself, by Josh Derksen, and the x-wing miniatures game by Fantasy Flight Games.

This project is maintained for free as a fun side project, so bugs and new features will be addressed as and when the time is available.
Pull requests for bugfixes are welcomed, but if you want to provide code for a new feature, please raise a ticket first (or fork your own version), as there is a limited functionality roadmap and various UX considerations to adding new features.
